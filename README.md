# Python AI
> ### A nureal network framework designed to be extended and modified to complete different tasks.
---
#### The framework works by creating many AI inside of an AI Classroom. Each AI is an indivisual class with methods for a nerual network. The AI Classroom holds these AI and controls them.
#### To use the AI Classroom, create a class that extends the AI Classroom and follow the instructions found in the AI Classroom *\_\_init\_\_* function or from the function *instructions*.
---
#### The framework has 3 different learning methods
1. **Learning:** *If new generation do not imporove, reverts back to old generation*
1. **Generational:** *Only the top X of a generation survive*
1. **Versuses:** *2 AI play agianst each other with winner surviving*
---
#### Other functionality of the framework:
- Store/Read AI Data
- Display Matrix *(What stores the Wieghts & Biases)*
- Make decisions post learn
- Test quality of result
- Randomize Weights and Biases

#### The Project currently has 3 extensions (Projects made using the framework) 
1. ~~**Multiplication**~~ *(Deprecated)*
1. ~~**Tic Tac Toe**~~ *(Deprecated)*
1. **2048**
