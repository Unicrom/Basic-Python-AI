# Projects
Some projects I have made

## AI
A simple Generational AI framework in python. It is made for easy varations to the methods, and has the optionn to record the matrix used by the AI for future use.

There are three extenstions for the frame work
1. Multiply: Attempts to multiple 2 numbers with a 2 digit output
2. 2048: Learns and plays a game of 2048. You can play the 2048 yourself if you set the ID for test to 'Fun'
3. Tic Tac Toe: Two AI's play agianst each other and train. (Does not work)
