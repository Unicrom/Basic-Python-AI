<p class="text">
I grew up as a military child and moved around a lot. This led to me attending many different elemntary schools. Almost 
going to a different school each year. During my 5th grade year, my dad retired. I have been here in XXX since.

<p class="text">
For middle school, I went to the XXX. I had a great experience with the teachers and the students. 
It is a lot different than Niceville, having only 280 student in all grades. It was nice being surronded by peers who wanted 
to learn just as much as I did.
